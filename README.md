# Machines
## Igniter
### Igniter lit a fire, in me figuratively but also any bug that wanders too close.
Quite beefy desktop pc, historically used for gaming on windows.
## Insomniac120
### Insomniac120 can't sleep because its always terrified of a potential power spike pushing it over 120W.
A server/NAS used as my homelab. It was designed for low power usage, at the cost of almost crashing on start up when the hard drives start spinning up.
## Strategist
### Strategist is a perfectionist wanting to do everything, it is in a constant dispute with the ipad over relaxing privileges.
Laptop that has only known linux. It is the work station for both school and personal use.

## Pioneer256
### Pioneer256 started a journey, what they found made them long for a better ship, they only 256GB of storage.

Older desktop pc that uses too much power to be used for a NAS 24/7, so it currently has no purpose in life.
