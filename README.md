# Machines
## Igniter
### Igniter lit a fire, in me figuratively but also any bug that wanders too close.
Quite beefy desktop pc, historically used for gaming on windows.
## Insomniac
### Insomniac can't sleep because its always terrified of a potential power spike pushing it over 120W.
A server/NAS used as my homelab. It was designed for low power usage, at the cost of almost crashing on startup when the hard drives start spinning up.
## Strategist
### Strategist is a perfectionist wanting to do everything, it's in constant dispute with the ipad over relaxing privileges.
Laptop that has only known linux. It is the work station for both school and personal use.

## Pioneer
### Pioneer started a journey, what they found made them long for a better ship.

Older desktop pc that uses too much power to be used for a NAS 24/7, so it currently has no purpose in life.
